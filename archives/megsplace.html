When I was very young my dad worked for a computer leasing company. Knowing it was within reach I begged for my own personal laptop. <br><br>
Eventually it came in the form of a Toshiba Satellite, with a jade green trackpoint. I have a fond memory of lying on the Afghan-carpeted floor
of our duplex browsing the internet for the first time in my life on the hot, heavy, very; very grey machine. <br><br>
One of the first websites I visited was Meg's Place. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19990302030900/http://www.megsplace.com/">Internet Archive</a> has done a good job at preserving it. <br><br>

I loved this website, and visited it frequently. When I put up my first websites I drew heavily from it. It was likely where I first saw some
mainstays of the early internet like bulletin boards, net pets, guestbooks. I loved the implementation of a "Button Board":<br><br>

Visitors to the page submitted their personal webpages for inclusion on the Button Board.The site itself was friendly,
and I enjoyed the feeling of being there. It seemed like something a cool baby-sitter or older sister would have designed.
I would have been around 11 or 12, and the site's creator was 16. <br><br>
Visited today, megsplace.com doesn't go anywhere interesting, nor does it's creator's second offering (digitalreflex.net). <br><br>
As you get older, who you are gets harder and harder to explain who you are to people. And with that, it gets harder and harder
to be known completely. It's hard not to be nostalgic for a time when your idea of who you were was a combination of all the thigs you liked.
And while there's no such thing as going back, there may still be purpose in remembering the fundamentals. <br><br>
